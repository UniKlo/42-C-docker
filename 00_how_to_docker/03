eval $(docker-machine env char)

# Define the variables needed by your virtual machine Char in the general env of your
# terminal, so that you can run the docker ps command without errors. You have
# to fix all four environment variables with one command, and you are not allowed
# to use your shellâ€™s builtin to set these variables by hand.
#Connect your shell to the new machine: https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/
#$ will run first. And out put the location of environment variables, then eval will run them.
