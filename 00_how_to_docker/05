docker run hello-world

#Test Docker installation: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
#When you call run, the Docker client finds the image (hello-world in this case), loads up the container and then runs a command in that container
#In our case, we didn't provide a command, so the container booted up, ran an empty command and then exited
#If there is no image locally, docker run will pull the image then run it.
#In the case that the image exists locally, docker run does not pull down the latest image.
